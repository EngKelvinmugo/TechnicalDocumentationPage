					What is C++?</u>
				</header>
				<p>
					
					C++ is an efficient
					and powerful language and finds wide use
					in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and
					real-time simulations. Being object-oriented
					programming like Java, C++ provides
					the support of inheritance, polymorphism,
					encapsulation, etc.
				</p>
				<p>he “Hello World” program is the first
					step towards learning any programming
					language and also one of the simplest
					programs you will learn.
					<br><br>Let us now look at the program :<br>
				</p>
				<code>
					#include<iostream>
					<br>
					using namespace std;
					<br>
					int main()
					<br>
						{
							<br>
							cout〈〈"Hello World";
							<br>
							return 0;
							<br>
						}
				</code>
				<br>
				<p>C++ is an Object Oriented Programming Language.
					<br> The main pillars of Object Oriented
					Programming are :
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Objects and Classes</li>
					<li>Inheritance</li>
					<li>Polymorphism</li>
					<li>Abstraction</li>
					<li>Encapsulation</li>
				</ul>

					Objects and Classes</u>
				</header>
				<p>
					Object-oriented programming – As the name
					suggests uses objects in programming.
					Object-oriented programming aims to
					implement real-world entities like
					inheritance, hiding, polymorphism,
					etc in programming. 
				</p>
				<p><b>Object : </b>An Object is an identifiable
					entity with some characteristics and behavior.
					An Object is an instance of a Class. When a
					class is defined, no memory is allocated but
					when it is instantiated (i.e. an
					object is created) memory is allocated.
					<br>
					<b>Class : </b>The building block of C++ that
					leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class.
					It is a user-defined data type, which holds its
					own data members and member functions, which can
					be accessed & used by creating an instance
					of that class.
			</section>

			<section class="main-section" id="Inheritance">
				<header>
					<u>Inheritance</u>
				</header>
				<p>
					The capability of a class to derive
					properties and characteristics from
					another class is called Inheritance.
					Inheritance is one of the most important
					feature of Object Oriented Programming.
					
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Mode of Inheritance : </b><br><br>

					<b>Public Mode : </b>If we derive a sub
					class from a public base class. ss.
					<br><br>
					<b>Protected Mode : </b>If we derive a
					sub class from a Protected base class.
					Then both public member and protected
					members of the base class will become
					protected in derived class.
					<br><br>
					<b>Private Mode : </b>If we derive a
					sub class from a Private base class.
					Then both public member and protected
					members of the base class will become
					Private in derived class.
					<br><br>
					<b>Types of Inheritance in C++ : </b>
					<br><br><br>
					<b>Single Inheritance :</b> In single
					inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit
					from only one class. i.e. one sub class
					is inherited by one base class only.
					<br><br>
					<b>Multiple Inheritance :</b> Multiple
					Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a
					class can inherit from more than one
					classes. i.e one sub class is inherited
					from more than one base classes.
					<br><br>
					<b>Multilevel Inheritance :</b> In this
					type of inheritance, a derived class is
					created from another derived class.
					<br><br>
					<b>Hieratical Inheritance :</b> In this
					type of inheritance, more than one sub
					class is inherited from a single base
					class i.e. more than one derived class
					is created from a single base class.
					<br><br>
					<b>Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance :</b>
					Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by
					combining more than one type of
					inheritance.
					For example: Combining Hierarchical
					inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.

			<section class="main-section" id="Polymorphism">
				<header>
					<u>Polymorphism</u>
				</header>
				<p>
					The word polymorphism means having many
					forms. In simple words, we can define
					polymorphism as the ability of a message
					to be displayed in more than one form.
					
					<br>
					<b>In C++ polymorphism is mainly
						divided into two types:</b>
					<br> 1. Compile time Polymorphism<br>
					2. Runtime Polymorphism
				</p>

				<p>Compile time polymorphism: This type of
					polymorphism is achieved by function
					overloading or operator overloading.
					<br> Runtime polymorphism: This type
					of polymorphism is achieved by
					Function Overriding.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="main-section" id="Abstraction">
				<header>
					<u>Abstraction</u>
				</header>

				<p>
					Data abstraction is one of the most
					essential and important feature of object
					oriented programming in C++. Abstraction
					means displaying only essential information
					and hiding the details. Data abstraction
					refers to providing only essential information
					about the data to the outside world,
					hiding the background details or implementation.
					
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Abstraction using Classes:</b> We can
					implement Abstraction in C++ using classes.
					Class helps us to group data members and member
					functions using available access specifiers. A
					Class can decide which data member will be
					visible to outside
					world and which is not.
					<br>
					<b>Abstraction in Header files:</b> One
					more type of abstraction in C++ can be
					header files. For example, consider the
					pow() method present in math.h header file.
					Whenever we need to calculate power of a
					number, we simply call the
					function pow() present in the math.h header
					file and pass the numbers as arguments
					without knowing the underlying algorithm
					according to which the function is actually
					calculating power of numbers.
					<br><br><b>Advantages of Data Abstraction:

					</b><br> 1. Helps the user to avoid writing
					the low level code.<br> 2. Avoids code
					duplication and increases reusability.<br>
					3. Can change internal implementation of
					class independently without
					affecting the user.<br> 4. Helps to
					increase security of an application or program
					as only important details are
					provided to the user.

			<section class="main-section" id="Encapsulation">
				<header>
					<u>Encapsulation</u>
				</header>
				<p>
					In normal terms Encapsulation is defined
					as wrapping up of data and information
					under a single unit. In Object Oriented
					Programming, Encapsulation is defined as
					binding together the data and the functions
					that manipulates them. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction
					or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides
					the data. <br>
					In C++ encapsulation
					can be implemented using Class
					and access modifiers.
